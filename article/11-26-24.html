                    <p>
                        Ladies and gentlemen, what we are seeing is
                        the latest advertisment campaign from
                        Microsoft. According to this ad, everything
                        from the actual console to your phone, laptop,
                        Amazon Fire TV Stick, Smart TV, to even your VR
                        headset, is an XBOX. Unfortunately, this comes
                        at the dismay of the hardcore XBOX fans, as it
                        feels that the pure XBOX consoles are becoming
                        more and more de-valued and the hardcore fandom
                        being abandoned.
                        It's been no small secret that Microsoft has been
                        shifting its focus away from traditional console
                        development and to a more cloud-based/3rd-party
                        focused one. Already, this noticable shift in
                        priority is much to the ire of XBOX fans; but,
                        this recent ad campaign seems to be yet another
                        nail in the coffin for the XBOX as a major player
                        in the gaming space.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The fall of XBOX as a console brand is attributed to
                        many things, but many fans will point the less than savory
                        reveal and launch of 2013's XBOX ONE. Simply put,
                        the beginning of the XBOX ONE's lifespan was a mess.
                        From the get-go, the 8th-gen console started off the
                        wrong foot for many of the XBOX faithful, as it seemed
                        more focused on TV and general entertainment than games,
                        was initially heavily-restricted for those without a
                        persistent Internet connection via DRM, was expensive
                        at launch, tried to turn game discs into glorified installation 
                        hardware, and lacked quality exclusive games compared
                        to its direct competition (i.e., the PS4). Coming off
                        the monolith success that was the XBOX 360, this to many
                        a XBOX fan was a massive dissapointment of all fronts.
                        Fortunately, the XBOX ONE would be able to fix itself
                        slightly throghout the 8th generation, but Microsoft and
                        the XBOX brand would never fully recover from this massive
                        blunder. In the twillight years of the XBOX ONE's lifespan,
                        we saw some features come out of XBOX that many found pretty
                        neat. These included features such as backwards compatibliy with
                        both the original XBOX and 360 and the cloud-based gaming service
                        XBOX Game Pass; which is the most revelevant to this recent
                        turn off events.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        While highly recieved and relatively successful when it first launched, 
                        the cloud service has had experienced slow growth since early 2022.
                        In fact, since last year of 2023, Game Pass has been in fact been <em>losing</em>
                        subscribers! There are many reasons for this, but as detailed by <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2024/05/11/xbox-game-pass-is-running-out-of-wells-to-dig-up-new-subscribers/">
                        Forbes</a>, the de-emphasizing of the the tradional XBOX consoles is
                        definitely a major one.
                        Forbes says, "Xbox has heavily de-emphasized console sales since even the 
                        previous generation, no longer reporting numbers and shrugging 
                        off big declines [...] And if you are not selling lots of new hardware, 
                        you are not growing Game Pass in the area it is most likely to grow."
                        Additionally, the Forbes article also details the fact the Game Pass
                        is also available on PC and potentially could also be coming to
                        XBOX's own rival platforms, the Nintendo Switch and the PlayStation 5 (
                        as f**king stupid as that may sound to many XBOX fans).

                        When you look at the happenings on Microsoft's end of the gaming sphere,
                        it's clear that the trillion-dollar corporation desires to go all-in on
                        Game Pass for the forseeable future of XBOX as a brand. However, many
                        gamers, myself included, simply do not think that this will go as
                        Microsoft hopes for. Forbes again explains, "cloud gaming is not the best way to play any games right now, 
                        [...] It may be serviceable, but given the choice between playing on hardware or playing on the cloud, you’re 
                        going to choose hardware. If you don’t want to pay for hardware, as Microsoft believes people don’t, 
                        you are mainly going to get people…not buying Xboxes [...] You may not even gain a subscriber 
                        if someone with an Xbox and a Game Pass subscription thinks cloud gaming 
                        is suddenly good enough and sells their Series X [...] You did nothing 
                        there but remove someone from your hardware ecosystem entirely."
                        In addition, there is the also the high possibility that Game Pass is
                        cannibalising sales of the of the games themselves. This is evidenced
                        from the initial closure of Tango Gameworks, a Bethesda-owned studio based
                        in Japan, in spite of the stealth hit of 2023's <em>Hi-Fi Rush</em>.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Simply put, despite <em>Hi-Fi Rush's</em> suprise success, selling excelent
                        on all fronts per Microsoft's own admission, Tango Gameworks, along with other
                        Bethesda-owned studios, was shut down later that year. Many people who analyzed
                        the situation theorized that Game Pass ate into actual potential sales of the game,
                        causing it to not sell the units that Microsoft truly wanted it to. All in all, despite
                        3 million players of the game over the course of just over 6 months, it wasn't enough for
                        Microsoft to keep investing in Tango, and thus the studio was closed in May 2024 until
                        holding company Krafton revived Tango Gameworks along with ownership of the <em>Hi-Fi Rush</em>
                        IP. To the surprise of no one, Microsoft's initial closing of Tango, among others, was seen
                        as yet another addition in the multitude of bad decisions made by the higher-ups
                        at Microsoft's gaming division, which brings us back to today.

                        The new "This is an XBOX" ad campaign is a very worrying reflection of Microsoft's
                        priorities with the XBOX going forward. Because of this ad alone, many gamers find themselves
                        asking "If this can become an XBOX, then what's the point of getting the XBOX console?"
                        As stated before, this is clearly Microsoft wanting to shift their focus away from
                        console development and go big on XBOX Game Pass, but with the service present as much
                        potential problems that it does, is it really going be worth it in the long run?
                        Who knows; but one thing's for sure: Microsoft has de-valued the XBOX brand in the eyes
                        of many and makes clear that the hardcore XBOX faithful is no longer their target audience.
                        Things remain to be seen, but to many, things are not looking good for XBOX. . .
